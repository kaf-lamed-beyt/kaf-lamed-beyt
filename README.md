### Hey

[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/5dd70ab7-53a0-4722-a5f5-38a635ebc727.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@5dd70ab7-53a0-4722-a5f5-38a635ebc727)

I'm excited about all things on the web — and developer tooling. 🫐🍓

But, I'm particular about the frontend ecosystem. I strive to share whatever I'm learning — through my [blog](https://meje.dev) — with developers at any opportunity I get, so they do not have to experience the difficulties I faced.

I find myself drifting towards the automation side of things, lately, and it's been intriguing! 🤖
