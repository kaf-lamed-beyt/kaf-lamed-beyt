### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/5dd70ab7-53a0-4722-a5f5-38a635ebc727.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@5dd70ab7-53a0-4722-a5f5-38a635ebc727)

I'm excited about all things on the web. But, I'm particular about the frontend ecosystem. I strive to share whatever I'm learning â€” through my [blog](https://meje.dev) â€” with developers at any opportunity I get, so they do not have to experience the difficulties I faced.

I am currently on the lookout for an entry-level or intern Frontend role, and I am particularly interested in creating opensource tools for developers.

I have contributed to, and built a small amount of OSS projects on GitHub so if you know any company that does stuff related to this, please let me know by reaching out.
