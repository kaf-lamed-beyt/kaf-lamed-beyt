### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited about all things on the web â€” and developer tools. But, I'm particular about the frontend ecosystem. I strive to share whatever I'm learning â€” through my [blog](https://meje.dev) â€” with developers at any opportunity I get, so they do not have to experience the difficulties I faced.
