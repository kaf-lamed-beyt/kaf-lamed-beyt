# Hey

I'm learning how to make stuff with code for people. When I'm not refactoring UIs, I improve my problem-solving skills by attempting algorithmic | data structure problems, and exploring &mdash; at the surface-level &mdash; a couple of FP languages

<!---
Here are some stuff I've developed, some of which I continue to work on and evolve:

- **[bb](https://github.com/storacha/bluesky-backup-cli)**: A CLI tool that helps you backup data from your Bluesky PDS, which I'm improving.
- **[Wasps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gitsecure.wasps)**: AI-powered VSCode extension for intelligent code reviews
- **[Livenormad](https://www.livenormad.com/)**: Connecting Canadian homeowners to manufacturers for affordable home decor.    
- **[twiBook](https://twibook.app/)**: A bookmarking tool and web extension for Twitter.

Letâ€™s connect &mdash; always happy to explore new ideas or opportunities!
