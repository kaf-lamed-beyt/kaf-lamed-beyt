# Hey

I’m a **UI Engineer** with a knack for ensuring that the products I build provide a good user experience for people who eventually use them. When I'm not refactoring UIs, I'm learning about Elixir and improving on my problem-solving skills by attempting algorithmic and data structure problems.

Here are some of the best products I've worked on;

- **[Wasps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gitsecure.wasps)**: AI code review tool in VScode.  
- **[Livenormad](https://www.livenormad.com/)**: Connecting Canadian homeowners to manufacturers for affordable home decor.    
- **[twiBook](https://twibook.app/)**: A bookmarking tool and web extension for Twitter.  

Let’s connect &mdash; always happy to explore new ideas or opportunities!
