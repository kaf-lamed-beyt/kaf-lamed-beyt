# Hey

I'm learning how to create good experiences for people with software. When I'm not refactoring UIs, I improve my problem-solving skills by attempting algorithmic | data structure problems, and exploring &mdash; at the surface-level &mdash; a couple of FP languages

Here are some of the best products I've worked on;

- **[Wasps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gitsecure.wasps)**: AI code review tool in VScode.  
- **[Livenormad](https://www.livenormad.com/)**: Connecting Canadian homeowners to manufacturers for affordable home decor.    
- **[twiBook](https://twibook.app/)**: A bookmarking tool and web extension for Twitter.  

Letâ€™s connect &mdash; always happy to explore new ideas or opportunities!
